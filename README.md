**Currency Exchange Forecasting For Asian Countires**


**Utilized Cloud Technologies:**
We are using Amazon Ec2 for web app deployment,if we have more time we
will enhance the application more by using Heroku or lambda for API
development.We may also netlify for the better frontend optimization

**Names & Roles:**
Nagaraju Rathna
Kalyan Naga Sai Nayani
Mohith Vanka
Sindhu Vardhan Madala
We have assigned roles for each person such as Development done by Nagaraju
& Sindhu Vardhan. Also ML data modelling by Nagaraju & Mohith.Kalyan &
Mohith collectively working on data engineering focusing on data that includes
testing and completing the missing data on dataset parallelly Sindhu & kalyan
taking care of testing the model and application. However, since it is difficult for
a single person to work on the tasks, we assigned them to each other, and we work
together and help each other in achieving those tasks with in the time.

**Things we tried and accomplished:**
We Collected Dataset from Kaggle and corrected missing data , trained and tested
the model.we partially developed frontend using react.js also started working on
the flask to export the created model.

**Things to do:**
We need to complete the flask application and frontend application. We also need
to deploy the model and the application on Amazon Ec2 Cloud.

**Challenges faced:**
While preprocessing and modelling the dataset we faced little challenge but the
Frontend and flask application development became easy.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
